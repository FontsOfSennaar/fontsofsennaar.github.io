I'm currently developing fonts that allows users to input glyphs from   ["Chants of Sennaar"](https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/chants-of-sennaar).
I've completed the Devotee font, which is based on Superior Mono, an open-source font created by Daniel Lyons.
I changed certain ligatures into in-game glyphs, thereby allowing users to input them via 'typing'. Before using the font, please make sure that font ligatures are enabled.

You can check out the glyphs and their corresponding inputs [here](https://fontsofsennaar.github.io/html/devotee). Special thanks to [Pere_Quisition](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pere_Quisition/), who generously allow me to refernce [this work](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChantsofSennaar/comments/1743ig8/i_sorted_all_the_glyphs_in_a_dictionary).
I'll continue working on other in-game languages.
Since I lack experience in both font and website development, any advice would be greatly appreciated!
